Book 01 Genesis
001:001 In the beginning God{After "God," the Hebrew has the two letters
        "Aleph Tav" (the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet)
        as a grammatical marker.} created the heavens and the earth.
001:002 Now the earth was formless and empty.  Darkness was on the surface
        of the deep.  God's Spirit was hovering over the surface
        of the waters.
001:003 God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
001:004 God saw the light, and saw that it was good.  God divided
        the light from the darkness.
001:005 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.
        There was evening and there was morning, one day.
001:006 God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters,
        and let it divide the waters from the waters."
001:007 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under
        the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse;
        and it was so.
001:008 God called the expanse sky.  There was evening and there
        was morning, a second day.
001:009 God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together
        to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so.
001:010 God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together
        of the waters he called Seas.  God saw that it was good.
001:011 God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed,
        and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed
        in it, on the earth;" and it was so.
001:012 The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind,
        and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind;
        and God saw that it was good.
001:013 There was evening and there was morning, a third day.
001:014 God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to
        divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,
        and for seasons, and for days and years;
001:015 and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light
        on the earth;" and it was so.
001:016 God made the two great lights:  the greater light to rule
        the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.
        He also made the stars.
001:017 God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,
001:018 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide
        the light from the darkness.  God saw that it was good.
001:019 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
001:020 God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures,
        and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky."
001:021 God created the large sea creatures, and every living
        creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed,
        after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind.
        God saw that it was good.
001:022 God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill
        the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."
001:023 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.
001:024 God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after
        their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth
        after their kind;" and it was so.
001:025 God made the animals of the earth after their kind,
        and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps
        on the ground after its kind.  God saw that it was good.
